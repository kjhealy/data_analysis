# Data Analysis

<!-- badges: start -->

A skeleton for a regular RMarkdown based R project, with both an `.Rproj` file and a Makefile. Both the Makefile and the YAML header of `template.Rmd` contain some hard-coded file paths that will need to be changed if anyone other than me wants to use this. 

The PDF output template relies on LaTeX configuration files that can be found in <https://github.com/kjhealy/latex-custom-kjh>.
